<h1>Chapter 3 Essay</h1>
<p>A great data model is established as being
  "truthful,accurate,informative" while also displaying complex
  data in a simple and clear way. Cairo also goes into detail
  about seeing the bigger picture. Some data visualizations
  can be misleading to those that do not understand the full
  story behind the data so it is important to inform the users
  with background information. The example that Cairo provided
  in the reading illustrated the conclusions his mind jumped
  to while looking at a visualization of the voting
  split in Ukraine. Cairo drew from that data that Ukraine should
  be two seperate countries which completely throws out
  the complexity of the political situation. This leads
  to a point that it is crucial to the interpretation of
  your data that you leave as little room as possible
  for misinterpretation. Cairo goes on to state three ways
  that a viewer can be mistaken when looking at data, these
  are the patternicity bug, the storytelling bug, and the confirmation bug.
  The patternicity bug is described by Cairo as the ability
  of the human mind to find patterns that may or may not
  be real. An example of this would be seeing patterns accross
  randomized data which would not mean anything, but your mind still thinks it does.
  The storytelling bug is when our minds try to create reasoning behind what we are
  seeing even if it isnt true and the confirmation bug makes us find information that
  supports our narrative and discard any information that doesnt. All of this adds to
  the human capability to fool itself without the help of others which makes it quintessential that
  data visualizers present data as truly as possible in order to keep people from making improper
  assumptions. This leads Cairo to discuss the truth continuum, which measures the scale of truth
  that is likely to come from any data. In order to provide the most truth possible, one must
  not only provide depth but also breadth to their presentation. A single statistic can not tell
  the whole story.

<h1>A Lie</h1>
<p>
  In life, one reason I have lied was to protect my families feelings by telling them
  certain food tasted good when it didnt.
By lying in this situation the only truth I think I am illustrating is that I care about the
feelings of the people I love enough to lie about how bad the food was.
 However, I am not entirely sure how one would do this
when presenting data because any lie could cause terrible consequences in how
the data is interpreted.
