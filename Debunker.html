    <title>A Climate of Confusion</title>

    <h1>Weather and Climate Are Not the Same</h1>
<p>One cause of confusion about global warming
is found between the terms of weather and climate. Weather represents
the day to day changes in temperature, humidity, and precipitation. Climate is weather averaged
over a specific period of time like a month. Therefore, one day of extremely cold weather
does not disprove of global warming if there is an overall increase in climate. A common myth is that climate
and weather represent the same
thing. The myth allows people that are looking for ways to disprove global warming a way to provide evidence
that supports their side while not taking into account the differences between climate and weather.</p>
<h1>Global Warming Does Not Always Mean the Temperature Gets Hotter</h1>
<p>Recently our winters have been getting much harsher. The trend of winter getting increasingly cold also follows
the trend of our summers getting incredibly hot. Scientists have concluded that fluctuations
in temperature can happen in both directions. A persistent myth is that the temperature always 
has to increase in order for global warming to be real. This myths existence can be blamed by the name
"global warming" because warming implies that the temperature must be steadily increasing, however, this is
not the case. </p>
