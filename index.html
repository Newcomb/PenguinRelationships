  <h3>Correlation Graph Essay</h3>
  <p>From first glance, it is clear which students have quiz
    grades that have strong or weak correlations. The contrast
    of the dark and light colors make it easy to spot possible
    cheaters. However, you should not jump to conclusions
    from the data presented in graphs like these because they
    do not display the full picture. If you found a high correlation
    it would be best to explore it further by looking at
    the actual quizzes in order to see similarities in
    the answers. The penguins may not have
    even goten the same answers right and wrong so it is
    almost impossible to declare someone is a cheater just
    from the data presented. If there was a way to compare
    answers from quizzes and find their correlations the
    reliability of finding cheaters would be much higher.
