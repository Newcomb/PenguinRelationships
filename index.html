  <h3>Correlation Graph Essay</h3>
  <p>From first glance, it is clear to see which students have quiz
    grades that have strong or weak correlations. The contrast
    of the dark and light colors make it easy to spot possible
    cheaters. However, you should not jump to conclusions
    from the data presented in graphs like these because they
    do not display the full picture. If you found a high correlation
    it would be best to explore it further by looking at
    the actual quizzes in order to see similarities in
    the answers or if the penguins even got the same answers
    right and wrong.
