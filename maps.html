      <h1>Common Mistakes: Maps</h1>
      <h3>Choosing the Map</h3>
      <p>Not all maps are created equal. Conformal maps strive
      to preserve the shape of the land while throwing off
    the ratios of some of the land it is portraying. The
  land nearest to the center of the map is closest to
its actual size while the farther you get from the midline the
larger the ratio grows. Equal-Area projections strive
to preserve area ratios but end up distorting the shape of the land.
A common mistake is using the wrong map depending on your purpose.
If you wished to give an accurate representation for the size
of a change (something like ice, fire, etc) it would be illogical to
use a conformal projection because it would make it appear that
the difference is higher or lower than it actually is. On the other hand,
using an equal-area projection to try and display exact locations
would return you a point that might not necessarily be accurate. </p>
      <h3>Sizing Symbols Improperly</h3>
      <p>Another mistake people tend to make when applying
      data to their maps is the sizing of their data points.
  It is easy to think that multiplying a circle by 200% will
double its size, however, Cairo illustrates that by multiplying
by 200% you are actually quadruplying the size of a circle
because when the diameter doubles the area quadruples. By making this mistake,
you are protraying incorrect size ratios for your data and could mislead your audience.
In order to fix this problem you can use the formula below.</p>
<br>
<p>R2 = SqrRt(New value/Largest value * R1</p>
      <h3>Misplacing Symbols</h3>
      <p>To make a good map visualization you have to know
      where to place your datapoints. Cairo makes it clear
    that "each symbol should be located where each value was observed."
  This rule keeps viewers from becoming confused about
the location of the event of data because near but not
exactly on the right spot. Cairo also gives guidelines for the
placement of differing types of data. If the data represents
a large area it should be placed in the center of that area
while if it represents a single place it should be placed
directly on that space. However, if clarity becomes an issue because
too much overlap occurs it is acceptable to slightly
displace your symbols in order to portray clearer data.</p>
